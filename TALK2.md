# Why Elm

## Please grab a handout

## Install Elm:

	`npm install -g elm elm-format elm-repl`  






<quote from Brad Grzesiak, CEO of Bendyworks in Madison:>
 "...JavaScript is troublesome, it is designed to swallow errors and move on â€“ something that we know is a wrong idea in programming!  Elm is an exciting language. It aims its scissors squarely at the knot of complexity that is frontend development, bringing the benefits of: static typing, functional programming, and purity.  "

< Hello I was a computer science teacher mostly in high schools and mostly in  New York City.  Now I test software in Madison.   This summer I started building small things in Elm.  It was my first functional language.  It was also my first use of Model-Update-View.  This is a talk for beginners.  I can show what I have learned so far. >

# to do:
Make handouts on better paper this time, not library paper

Make the bundled zip clonable stuff for folks

History browser
* write page.elm so it just serves a short list of things, no headline.  compiles to page.html <students add in the things themselves>
* add h1, h3 headlines (oops, no exposed) with purpose and your name
* cat .bash_history to history_november.txt
* write elm function to bring it in to the list
* graft on to html frame with the css
* stitch on the searcher

Actual MD to present

Flash cards all the time, post its on top of postits
Todo:
* grab a pointer

* have a time strategy so you run short, not long

* save handout as pdf for Kinkos



## PRIOR SEQUENCE, 11/4:
Talk sequence:
0) Screen with install instructions, and 30 min talk, 30 min try out the

1) My two sentences, tight, verbatim.  Just read my official bio? Fun 
fact:  Beyond Compare is written in Pascal!
2) A quick sentence, what was good just now in the 9am session? I was 
checking my tech. (In case they froze, you prompt, with list.)
2) A quick sentence, what you have heard about Elm.  
2) 60 seconds, what to expect. Show my links.
3) Compile one tiny thing.  
4) Show the dream-catcher
5) Go to the elm-lang.org, cover their points.
6) Show 2 min VIDEO
7) Show some examples in production.  
	* Pete at FordMoCo
	* No Red Ink
