Make the bundled zip clonable stuff for folks

History browser
* write page.elm so it just serves a short list of things, no headline.  compiles to page.html <students add in the things themselves>
* add h1, h3 headlines (oops, no exposed) with purpose and your name
* cat .bash_history to history_november.txt
* write elm function to bring it in to the list
* graft on to html frame with the css
* stitch on the searcher
