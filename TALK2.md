## Please grab a handout

## Install Elm:

	`npm install -g elm elm-format elm-repl`  

<quote from Brad Grzesiak, CEO of Bendyworks in Madison:>
 "...JavaScript is troublesome, it is designed to swallow errors and move on â€“ something that we know is a wrong idea in programming!  Elm is an exciting language. It aims its scissors squarely at the knot of complexity that is frontend development, bringing the benefits of: static typing, functional programming, and purity.  "

< Hello I was a computer science teacher mostly in high schools and mostly in  New York City.  Now I test software in Madison.   This summer I started building small things in Elm.  It was my first functional language.  It was also my first use of Model-Update-View.  This is a talk for beginners.  I can show what I have learned so far. >
