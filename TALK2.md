## to do:
Make handouts on better paper this time, not library paper

Make the bundled zip clonable stuff for folks

* add h1, h3 headlines (oops, no exposed) with purpose and your name
* cat .bash_history to history_november.txt
* write elm function to bring it in to the list
* graft on to html frame with the css
* stitch on the searcher

Actual MD to present
